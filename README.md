# Image-Synthesis

This project discussed the implementation  colorization of images using Generative Adversarial networks. A website was built using HTML and CSS. This website served as a platform where users could easily upload their images, apply colorization algorithms, and visualize the results in real-time. The backend functionality of the website was implemented using the Flask framework in Python, ensuring seamless integration and smooth operation. GANs is a machine learning (ML) model in which two neural networks compete with each other to become more accurate in their predictions; a supervised learning algorithm that belongs to the set of generative models.
